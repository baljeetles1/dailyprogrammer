# Daily Programming Challenges
This is where I am storing challenges from [dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) which is more like weekly excersizes than daily. I am starting with 370 and will hopefully be updating with every attempt whether successful or not. I may also store other programming excersized I do here, but they will be named differently. Naming for main excersize directories will the `ch#` if from reddit, otherwise will be `ch_location_#ihavedone`
